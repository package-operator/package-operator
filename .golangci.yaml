  # One can't use disable and disable-all. disable-all is preferred to avoid lint failing when golangci gets updated and linters are added.
  # at the same time but it is nice to explicitly state which linters we do not want.
  #disable:
  #- containedctx     # Context.Context within a struct a struct (as opposed to a func parameter) is nasty for many reasons, but actually sometimes useful.
  #- contextcheck     # Not that useful/false positives.
  #- cyclop           # Cyclo complexity already calculated by other linters.
  #- depguard         # We do not restrict imports.
  #- dogsled          # Could be nice in the future.
  #- dupl             # Could be nice in the future.
  #- exhaustive       # Not that useful/false positives.
  #- exhaustruct      # Not that useful/false positives.
  #- forcetypeassert  # We want a panic in situations when a type is asserted.
  #- funlen           # We really like long functions.
  #- gci              # Conflicts with other linters.
  #- gochecknoglobals # We need globals.
  #- gochecknoinits   # We have a lot of those.
  #- gocognit         # Not that useful/false positives.
  #- godox            # Not that useful/false positives.
  #- gomnd            # The annoy is strong.
  #- gomoddirectives  # Not that useful/false positives.
