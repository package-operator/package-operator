                      The `Watch` strategy watches the source object for changes and queues re-synchronization whenever a the manager observes a write to a source.
                      Caution: package-operator will add a label to the source object to make it visible to its in-memory caches which can lead to a write cascade on the object
                      if it is managed by a controller that insists on owning the full shape of the object. You can use the `Poll` strategy instead if you observe this happening,
                      and have reasons not to change the behaviour of the controller in question.
