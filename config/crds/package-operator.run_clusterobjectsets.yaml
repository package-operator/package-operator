          ClusterObjectSet reconciles a collection of objects through ordered phases and aggregates their status.

          ClusterObjectSets behave similarly to Kubernetes ReplicaSets, by managing a collection of objects and
          being itself mostly immutable. This object type is able to suspend/pause reconciliation of specific
          objects to facilitate the transition between revisions.

          Archived ClusterObjectSets may stay on the cluster, to store information about previous revisions.

          A Namespace-scoped version of this API is available as ObjectSet.
