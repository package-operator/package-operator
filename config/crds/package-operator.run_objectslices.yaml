          ObjectSlice is referenced by ObjectSets or ObjectDeployments and contain objects to
          limit the size of ObjectSets and ObjectDeployments when big packages are installed.
          This is necessary to work around the etcd object size limit of ~1.5MiB and to reduce load on the kube-apiserver.
